Human Activity Recognition Tidy Data Project
# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set for human activity recognition using smartphone sensors.

## Files Description
- `Run_analysis.R` - Main R script that performs the data analysis
- `tidy_data.txt` - Final tidy data set generated by the script
- `Codebook.md` - Describes variables, data, and transformations

## Analysis Steps
The R script `Run_analysis.R` performs the following:

1. **Merges** the training and test sets to create one data set
2. **Extracts** only measurements on the mean and standard deviation
3. **Uses** descriptive activity names to name the activities
4. **Appropriately labels** the data set with descriptive variable names
5. **Creates** a second, independent tidy data set with averages for each variable per activity per subject

## How to Run
1. Download the source data from: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
2. Place the `UCI HAR Dataset` folder in your working directory
3. Run the script: `source("Run_analysis.R")`
4. The output will be saved as `tidy_data.txt`

## Tidy Data Set
- Dimensions: 180 rows Ã— 68 columns
- Subjects: 30 volunteers
- Activities: 6 activities
- Each row represents averages for each variable per activity per subject
